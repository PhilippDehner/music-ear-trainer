# Backend

Currently the backend is used to run the frontend without the necessity of installed npm.

## Building

To build the backend, run `build.cmd`.
This script will run the dotnet publish process and create a zip file with the backend and frontend: `music-ear-trainer.zip`.
The publish folder is the folder named `publish`.

## Usage

1. Extract the zip folder `music-ear-trainer.zip`.
1. Run the `backend.exe` via command line or starting in Windows explorer.
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
